            <h1>0. Add Name and Email</h1>
            <p>Whenever we commit some code, so we saw our name and email for identifing that which commit is done by which person. It's usually vital if one is working with Tech gaints like Facebook.</p>
            <h2>Set your email and name for the first time using Git:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>${ git config --global user.name Ahsan\ Azeemi }</b>: This command will set the username to Ahsan Azeemi, and whenever this user commit something, this name will append to the output.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>${ git config --global user.email ahsanazeemiofficial@gmail.com }</b>: This command will set the useremail to ahsanazeemiofficial@gmail.com, and whenever this user commit something, this email will also append to the output.

            <p>For the first time for creating a git directory, it must be called. It is used to initilazie Git in current directory.<br>For example: <b>git init</b></p>
        </div>

        <div class="command_div">
            <h1>2. git status</h1>
            <p>It is used to see what is the status of current git direcoty.<br>For example: <b>git status</b></p>

        <div class="command_div">
            <h1>Important!</h1>
            <p>If you add files to Stagged Area, and then edit again without commiting. So it will show you the previous version of your file which is in Stagged Area. Just run <b>git add -A</b> to add all of files to Stagged Area (Tracked and Untracked) both.</p>
        </div>

                &nbsp; &nbsp;<li><b>${ git commit -m}</b>: Instead of opening Vim, this will commit the files with the log which you wrote after -m in double quotes.  <br>For example: <b>git commit -m "Initial Commit"</b></li>

                &nbsp; &nbsp;<li><b>${ git commit -am}</b>: Instead of adding all files to Stagged Area, then comitting them, you can just do it directly by this command.   <br>For example: <b>git commit -am "Update index.html"</b></li>

                &nbsp; &nbsp;<li><b>${ git log -p }</b>: This command gives details of every commit. We can also limit the number of output by adding the total number of output flags. <br>For example: <b>git log -p -3</b></li>
